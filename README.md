# üåâ Bifrost - High-Performance Automation Software Engineering Support Tool

**Bifrost** is a high-performance industrial gateway built in Go that bridges OT equipment with modern IT infrastructure. This project is in its infancy and would benefit significantly from folks with expertise using it, finding does and does not work and helping us get a useful set of tools assembled. 

## üèÜ Core Features

- **High-Performance Go Gateway**: Achieves 18,879 ops/sec with 53¬µs latency.
- **Protocol Support**: Native Modbus TCP/RTU, with OPC UA and others in development.
- **Modern IT Integration**: RESTful APIs, WebSocket streaming, and Prometheus metrics.
- **Cross-Platform**: Single binary deployment for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- **VS Code Extension**: Enhances development with real-time monitoring and debugging.

## üí° Architecture

The new architecture enhances performance and scalability by separating the Go-based gateway from the TypeScript-based VS Code extension. This design ensures that the core gateway remains lightweight and efficient, while the frontend provides a rich user experience.
