# 🌉 Bifrost - Bridge Your OT Equipment to Modern IT Infrastructure

**Bifrost** makes industrial equipment speak the language of modern software. Built for engineers stuck between the OT and IT worlds.

## 🤝 The Problem We're Solving

If you've ever tried to:

- Get data from a 20-year-old PLC into your cloud analytics platform
- Make your MES talk to equipment using 5 different protocols
- Run Python on an industrial edge device without it melting down
- Explain to IT why you can't "just use REST APIs" for everything

...then Bifrost is for you.

## 🔧 What Bifrost Does

We're building the Python toolkit that automation professionals actually want - one that understands both worlds:

- **Speaks OT**: Native support for Modbus, OPC UA, Ethernet/IP, S7 - the protocols your equipment actually uses
- **Thinks IT**: Modern async Python, JSON outputs, cloud-ready, plays nice with your IT stack
- **Runs Everywhere**: From your industrial PC to a Raspberry Pi to the cloud - same code, same reliability
- **Fast Enough**: Rust-powered performance that won't slow down your production line

## 🎯 Our Mission

Break down the walls between operational technology and information technology. Make it as easy to work with a PLC as it is to work with a REST API. Help automation professionals leverage modern tools without abandoning what works.

## 👥 Who Should Join

- **Control Systems Engineers** tired of duct-taping solutions together
- **Automation Engineers** who want modern development tools
- **SCADA/HMI Developers** looking for better Python libraries
- **IT Developers** who need to understand industrial equipment
- **System Integrators** seeking reliable, performant tools
- **Process Engineers** trying to get data into analytics platforms
- **Anyone** bridging the OT/IT gap

## 💡 The Vision

```python
# Industrial data should be this simple
from bifrost import connect

# Connect to any industrial equipment
async with connect("modbus://10.0.0.100") as equipment:
    # Get data in formats IT understands
    data = await equipment.read_tags(["temperature", "pressure"])
    
    # Send it anywhere IT lives
    await send_to_cloud(data)  # Your MES, ERP, data lake, anywhere
```
