**Bifrost** is a high-performance industrial gateway built in Go that bridges OT equipment with modern IT infrastructure. Production-ready with proven performance improvements.

## 🤝 The Problem We're Solving

If you've ever tried to:

- Get data from a 20-year-old PLC into your cloud analytics platform
- Make your MES talk to equipment using 5 different protocols
- Deploy reliable industrial communication at scale
- Explain to IT why you can't "just use REST APIs" for everything

...then Bifrost is for you.

## 🔧 What Bifrost Delivers

A production-ready industrial gateway that combines OT protocol expertise with IT-grade architecture:

- **Speaks OT**: Native support for Modbus TCP/RTU, Ethernet/IP, with OPC UA and S7 coming soon
- **Thinks IT**: RESTful APIs, WebSocket streaming, Prometheus metrics, cloud-ready
- **Runs Everywhere**: From industrial PCs to edge devices to cloud - single binary deployment
- **Blazing Fast**: Go-powered performance - 18,879 ops/sec with 53µs latency

## 🎯 Our Mission

Break down the walls between operational technology and information technology. Make it as easy to work with a PLC as it is to work with a REST API. Help automation professionals leverage modern tools without abandoning what works.

## 👥 Who Should Join

- **Control Systems Engineers** tired of duct-taping solutions together
- **Automation Engineers** who want modern development tools
- **SCADA/HMI Developers** looking for better Python libraries
- **IT Developers** who need to understand industrial equipment
- **System Integrators** seeking reliable, performant tools
- **Process Engineers** trying to get data into analytics platforms
- **Anyone** bridging the OT/IT gap
