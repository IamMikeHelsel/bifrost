# Bifrost Development Roadmap

## Building the Bridge to Industrial Edge Computing

### Timeline: 12-18 months to full v1.0 release

### Team Size: 3-5 developers (mix of Python and Rust expertise)

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 0: Foundation (Months 1-2)

**Goal**: Establish project infrastructure and core architecture

### Technology Stack

**Core Platform**:

- **Python**: 3.13+ (leveraging latest performance improvements)
- **Rust**: Latest stable via PyO3 for performance-critical components
- **Async Runtime**: asyncio with uvloop for production deployments

**CLI & User Interface**:

- **Rich**: Modern terminal formatting and colors
- **Typer**: Type-safe CLI framework with automatic help generation
- **Textual**: TUI framework for dashboard mode
- **Click**: Fallback for complex command structures

**Development Tools**:

- **Build System**: setuptools + maturin for Rust extensions
- **Testing**: pytest + pytest-asyncio for async testing
- **Type Checking**: mypy with strict configuration
- **Code Formatting**: black + isort + ruff for linting
- **Documentation**: Sphinx with modern theme

### Library Strategy & Licensing

**Open Source First**: Leverage high-quality, maintained libraries where possible

- **Permissive Licensing**: MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD compatible
- **Active Maintenance**: Regular updates and security patches
- **Performance Proven**: Benchmarked and production-tested

**Core Dependencies**:

- **asyncio-mqtt**: For MQTT connectivity (Apache 2.0)
- **aiomodbus**: Async Modbus implementation (MIT)
- **asyncua**: OPC UA client/server (LGPL - evaluate alternatives)
- **uvloop**: High-performance event loop (Apache 2.0)
- **msgpack**: Fast serialization (Apache 2.0)
- **orjson**: Fast JSON parsing (Apache 2.0)
- **pydantic**: Data validation (MIT)

**Protocol Libraries**:

- **pymodbus**: Mature Modbus library (BSD)
- **snap7**: Siemens S7 communication (MIT)
- **cpppo**: Ethernet/IP support (GPL - need permissive alternative)
- **open62541**: OPC UA C library (Mozilla Public License)

**Build vs. Buy Decision Matrix**:

- ‚úÖ Use existing: Well-maintained, permissive license, good performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Wrap existing: Good functionality but restrictive license
- ‚ùå Build new: No suitable library or unacceptable licensing
