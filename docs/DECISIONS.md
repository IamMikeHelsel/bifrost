# Bifrost Development Decisions

This document tracks key architectural and implementation decisions made during the development of Bifrost.

## Decision Log

### 2025-01-05: Project Structure - Monorepo with Multiple Packages

**Decision**: Use a monorepo structure with multiple packages instead of a single large package.

**Rationale**:

- **Modularity**: Users can install only what they need (e.g., just Modbus support)
- **Dependency Management**: Heavy dependencies (like OPC UA libraries) don't affect basic users
- **Build Times**: Faster CI/CD for individual packages
- **Maintenance**: Easier to maintain and test individual components

**Trade-offs**:

- More complex release process (mitigated by tooling)
- Need to maintain version synchronization
- Requires good monorepo tooling (using uv workspace features)

**Implementation**:

- Each package in `packages/` directory
- Shared version management
- Smart imports with helpful error messages for missing packages

### 2025-01-05: Technology Stack - Modern Python Tooling

**Decision**: Use uv, ruff, and just instead of traditional Python tooling.

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: uv is 10-100x faster than pip
- **Developer Experience**: Faster feedback loops
- **Cross-platform**: just works better than make on Windows
- **Modern Standards**: Aligns with current Python ecosystem trends

**Trade-offs**:

- Less familiar to some developers (mitigated by good documentation)
- Newer tools may have less community support
- Requires installation of additional tools

**Implementation**:

- uv for package management
- ruff for linting and formatting
- just for task running
- Clear setup instructions in README

### 2025-01-05: Async Architecture - asyncio as Primary Interface

**Decision**: Make all I/O operations async-first using asyncio.

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: Better handling of concurrent connections
- **Modern Python**: Aligns with Python 3.13+ improvements
- **Industrial Use Case**: PLCs often require concurrent monitoring
- **Future-proof**: Async is the direction Python is moving

**Trade-offs**:

- Steeper learning curve for some users
- More complex testing
- Need to provide sync wrappers for simple use cases

**Implementation**:

- All protocol implementations use async/await
- Context managers for resource management
- Optional sync wrappers for simple scripts

### 2025-01-05: Performance Strategy - Rust for Critical Paths

**Decision**: Use Rust via PyO3 for performance-critical components.

**Rationale**:

- **Performance**: 10-100x speedup for protocol parsing
- **Memory Safety**: Rust guarantees prevent common bugs
- **Compatibility**: PyO3 provides excellent Python integration
- **Edge Devices**: Critical for resource-constrained environments

**Trade-offs**:

- More complex build process
- Requires Rust knowledge for core development
- Longer initial development time

**Implementation**:

- Modbus codec in Rust
- Time-series storage engine in Rust
- OPC UA performance layer in Rust
- Pure Python fallbacks where possible

### 2025-01-05: CLI Design - Rich Terminal Experience

**Decision**: Build a beautiful CLI with Rich, Typer, and Textual.

**Rationale**:

- **User Experience**: Industrial users deserve beautiful tools
- **Productivity**: Visual feedback improves efficiency
- **Modern Standards**: Aligns with modern CLI tools
- **Accessibility**: Better for colorblind users with themes

**Trade-offs**:

- Larger dependency footprint
- More complex than simple print statements
- Need to handle terminal compatibility

**Implementation**:

- Rich for colors and formatting
- Typer for command structure
- Textual for TUI dashboards
- Theme system for customization

### 2025-01-05: Protocol Support - Unified API Design

**Decision**: Create a protocol-agnostic API that works the same across all protocols.

**Rationale**:

- **Simplicity**: Users learn one API for all protocols
- **Flexibility**: Easy to switch protocols
- **Maintenance**: Single API to maintain and document
- **Testing**: Can test with protocol simulators

**Trade-offs**:

- May not expose protocol-specific features
- Abstraction overhead
- Need careful design to avoid leaky abstractions

**Implementation**:

- BaseProtocol and BaseConnection interfaces
- Tag-based addressing system
- Automatic type conversion
- Protocol-specific extensions when needed

### 2025-01-05: Testing Strategy - Comprehensive Test Coverage

**Decision**: Require >90% test coverage with multiple test types.

**Rationale**:

- **Reliability**: Industrial systems require high reliability
- **Maintenance**: Tests prevent regressions
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples
- **Confidence**: Users trust well-tested software

**Trade-offs**:

- Slower initial development
- More code to maintain
- Need test infrastructure (simulators, etc.)

**Implementation**:

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests with simulators
- Performance benchmarks
- Property-based testing where applicable

### 2025-01-05: Package Distribution - PyPI with Binary Wheels

**Decision**: Distribute via PyPI with pre-built wheels for all platforms.

**Rationale**:

- **Ease of Use**: Simple pip/uv install
- **Performance**: Binary wheels include Rust extensions
- **Compatibility**: Works on all major platforms
- **Standard**: PyPI is the Python standard

**Trade-offs**:

- Complex CI/CD for multi-platform builds
- Large package sizes with binaries
- Need to maintain multiple build environments

**Implementation**:

- GitHub Actions for multi-platform builds
- cibuildwheel for wheel building
- Automated releases on tags
- Support for x86_64 and ARM64

### 2025-01-05: Documentation Strategy - Comprehensive and Beautiful

**Decision**: Invest heavily in documentation with multiple formats.

**Rationale**:

- **Adoption**: Good docs drive adoption
- **Support**: Reduces support burden
- **Professional**: Shows project maturity
- **Learning**: Different users prefer different formats

**Trade-offs**:

- Significant time investment
- Need to keep multiple formats in sync
- Documentation can become outdated

**Implementation**:

- API reference (auto-generated)
- User guide with tutorials
- Architecture documentation
- Video tutorials
- Example repository

### 2025-01-05: Security Model - Defense in Depth

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive security at all layers.

**Rationale**:

- **Industrial Requirements**: OT security is critical
- **Compliance**: Many industries require security
- **Trust**: Users need to trust the system
- **Future-proof**: Security requirements increasing

**Trade-offs**:

- More complex implementation
- Performance overhead
- Harder to use for simple cases

**Implementation**:

- TLS/SSL for all network communication
- Certificate management utilities
- Audit logging

1. **Licensing Model**: Open source license selection
1. **Governance Model**: How to manage community contributions
1. **Enterprise Features**: What belongs in open source vs. commercial
1. **Cloud Services**: Whether to offer hosted services
1. **Certification**: Whether to pursue industrial certifications
