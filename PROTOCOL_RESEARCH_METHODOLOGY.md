# Protocol Research Methodology

## Purpose

This document defines the methodology for researching industrial protocol popularity to make data-driven prioritization decisions for Bifrost protocol support.

## Scoring Framework

Each protocol receives a score from 0-100 based on weighted metrics:

### Quantitative Metrics (70% weight)

1. **Python Ecosystem Maturity (20%)**
   - PyPI monthly downloads for major libraries
   - GitHub stars and activity for key repositories
   - Number of actively maintained libraries

2. **Market Adoption (25%)**
   - Hardware vendor support
   - Market share data from industry reports
   - Geographic distribution

3. **Industry Demand (25%)**
   - Job posting mentions
   - Skills requirements in automation roles
   - Professional certification programs

### Qualitative Factors (30% weight)

4. **Future Outlook (15%)**
   - Standards body activity
   - Vendor roadmaps and investment
   - Industry 4.0 alignment

5. **Integration Complexity (15%)**
   - Existing Python library quality
   - Implementation complexity
   - Performance requirements

## Data Sources

### Primary Sources
- **PyPI**: pypistats.org for download metrics
- **GitHub**: Repository metrics via GitHub API
- **Industry Reports**: HMS, ARC Advisory, automation magazines
- **Job Markets**: Indeed, LinkedIn skills analysis

### Secondary Sources
- Standards organization websites (OPC Foundation, ODVA, etc.)
- Vendor documentation and market data
- Academic research and conference papers
- Community forums and developer surveys

## Research Schedule

### Quarterly Updates
- Review PyPI download trends
- Update GitHub metrics
- Check for new industry reports
- Monitor job market trends

### Annual Deep Dive
- Comprehensive market analysis
- Vendor ecosystem assessment
- Technology trend evaluation
- Community feedback integration

## Implementation

1. **Data Collection**: Automated scripts for metrics gathering
2. **Analysis**: Standardized scoring spreadsheet
3. **Validation**: Community review and expert input
4. **Documentation**: Updated priority rankings and justifications
5. **Integration**: Update roadmap and issue priorities

## Quality Assurance

- **Multiple Sources**: No single data point drives decisions
- **Peer Review**: Technical community validation
- **Transparency**: All methodology and sources documented
- **Continuous Improvement**: Refine metrics based on outcomes

This methodology ensures protocol prioritization remains objective, transparent, and responsive to market changes.
