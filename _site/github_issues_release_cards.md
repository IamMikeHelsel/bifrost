## Main Issue: Release Card System - Document Tested Fieldbus and Endpoint Compatibility

**Title**: Release Card System: Document Tested Fieldbus and Endpoint Compatibility

**Labels**: enhancement, documentation, testing, later-phase

**Body**:

```markdown
## Overview

Create a comprehensive release card system that documents and tracks every fieldbus protocol and endpoint tested for each software release. This will provide users with clear compatibility information and help maintain testing coverage as the project grows.

## Problem Statement

Users need to understand:
- Which industrial protocols are supported in each release
- What devices have been tested (virtual vs real hardware)  
- Compatibility matrices for different protocol versions
- Performance characteristics and limitations
- Known issues and workarounds

## Proposed Solution

Implement a structured release card system that automatically generates compatibility documentation for each release, including:

### 1. Protocol Testing Matrix
- Modbus TCP/RTU compatibility
- OPC UA server compatibility (different vendors)
- Ethernet/IP device support
- Siemens S7 PLC compatibility
- Other fieldbus protocols

### 2. Device Testing Registry
- Virtual device test coverage
- Real hardware test results
- Vendor-specific device validation
- Protocol version compatibility

### 3. Performance Benchmarks
- Throughput metrics per protocol
- Latency measurements
- Concurrent connection limits
- Resource usage characteristics

### 4. Release Documentation
- Automated generation from test results
- Standardized format across releases
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline
- User-friendly compatibility charts

## Benefits

- **User Confidence**: Clear documentation of what's been tested
- **Quality Assurance**: Systematic tracking of testing coverage
- **Release Planning**: Identify gaps in testing matrix
- **Customer Support**: Reference for compatibility questions
- **Marketing**: Demonstrate broad device compatibility

## Implementation Timeline
