# Bandwidth Limiting Simulation

## Purpose
Simulate bandwidth-constrained networks for performance testing.

## Planned Contents
- **Fixed Bandwidth**: Constant rate limiting (56K - 1Gbps)
- **Variable Bandwidth**: Time-based bandwidth changes
- **Asymmetric Bandwidth**: Different upload/download rates
- **Burst Bandwidth**: Temporary bandwidth spikes

## Key Features
- Configurable rate limits
- Traffic shaping algorithms
- Real-time bandwidth adjustments
- Utilization monitoring

## Use Cases
- Cellular/satellite connection simulation
- Legacy network testing
- Bandwidth optimization validation
- QoS policy testing

## Testing Focus
- Data compression effectiveness
- Protocol efficiency under constraints
- Bandwidth utilization optimization
- Priority-based data transmission
