# Connection Failure Simulation

## Purpose
Simulate network disconnections and connection failures for resilience testing.

## Planned Contents
- **Scheduled Disconnections**: Planned connection interruptions
- **Random Failures**: Statistical connection loss simulation
- **Partial Connectivity**: Selective protocol/port blocking
- **Recovery Scenarios**: Connection restoration patterns

## Key Features
- Configurable failure patterns
- Duration-based disconnections
- Selective service blocking
- Automated recovery simulation

## Use Cases
- Network infrastructure failures
- Power outage simulation
- Maintenance window testing
- Disaster recovery validation

## Testing Focus
- Connection retry logic
- Data buffering during outages
- Graceful degradation
- Recovery time validation
