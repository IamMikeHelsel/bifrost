# Network Latency Simulation

## Purpose
Inject configurable network latency for testing protocol resilience.

## Planned Contents
- **Fixed Latency**: Constant delay injection (1ms - 1000ms)
- **Variable Latency**: Jitter simulation with statistical distributions
- **Asymmetric Latency**: Different upstream/downstream delays
- **Time-based Patterns**: Latency variations over time

## Key Features
- Configurable delay ranges
- Statistical distributions (normal, uniform, exponential)
- Real-time latency adjustments
- Latency measurement and reporting

## Use Cases
- WAN/cellular connection simulation
- Satellite communication testing
- Network congestion scenarios
- Protocol timeout validation

## Testing Focus
- Protocol timeout handling
- Retry mechanism validation
- Performance under high latency
- Real-time requirement validation
