# Packet Loss Simulation

## Purpose
Simulate packet loss for testing protocol reliability and recovery.

## Planned Contents
- **Random Loss**: Statistical packet dropping (0.1% - 10%)
- **Burst Loss**: Consecutive packet loss patterns
- **Conditional Loss**: Loss based on packet size/type
- **Pattern-based Loss**: Scheduled loss scenarios

## Key Features
- Configurable loss percentages
- Burst loss simulation
- Packet type filtering
- Loss pattern recording

## Use Cases
- Wireless network simulation
- Congested network testing
- Protocol reliability validation
- Error recovery testing

## Testing Focus
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Data integrity validation
- Connection recovery
- Performance degradation under loss
