# Protocol Mocks

## Purpose
Lightweight, in-memory protocol mocks for fast unit testing.

## Contents
- Minimal protocol implementations
- Predictable behavior for edge cases
- No network dependencies
- Fast execution (< 1ms per test)

## Usage
- Unit testing individual components
- Testing error conditions and edge cases
- Rapid test execution in CI/CD
- Isolated component testing

## Future Plans
- Auto-generated mocks from protocol specifications
- Behavior recording and playback
- Fuzzing test data generation
- Property-based testing integration
