# Ethernet/IP Mocks

## Purpose
Lightweight Ethernet/IP protocol mocks for unit testing.

## Planned Contents
- **CIP Mock**: Common Industrial Protocol message simulation
- **Tag Mock**: Tag-based addressing simulation
- **Connection Mock**: Implicit/explicit connection simulation
- **Device Profile Mock**: Standard device profile behavior

## Key Features
- Tag-based data access
- Connection state simulation
- Device profile responses
- CIP service simulation

## Usage Patterns
- Unit testing Ethernet/IP clients
- Tag discovery testing
- Connection management testing
- Device profile validation

## Test Focus
- Tag-based addressing
- CIP service requests
- Connection establishment
- Device profile compliance
