# Ethernet/IP Simulators

## Purpose
Ethernet/IP (Common Industrial Protocol) simulators for Allen-Bradley and compatible devices.

## Planned Contents
- **CIP Scanner**: Ethernet/IP scanner simulation
- **Adapter Simulator**: I/O adapter and device simulation
- **Explicit Messaging**: Tag-based read/write operations
- **Implicit Messaging**: Real-time I/O data exchange

## Key Features
- Complete CIP protocol implementation
- Tag-based addressing system
- Real-time I/O data exchange
- Explicit messaging support
- Connection management
- Device profiles (Generic, Motor, Drive, etc.)

## Performance Targets
- 5,000+ tags/second throughput
- < 5ms real-time I/O update rates
- 50+ concurrent connections
- Tag browsing and discovery

## Testing Focus
- Tag-based data access
- Real-time I/O performance
- Connection establishment/teardown
- Device profile compliance
- Allen-Bradley compatibility
