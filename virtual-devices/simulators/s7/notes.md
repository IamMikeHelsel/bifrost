# Siemens S7 Simulators

## Purpose
Siemens S7 protocol simulators for S7-300, S7-400, and S7-1200/1500 PLCs.

## Planned Contents
- **S7 Server**: Complete S7 communication server
- **Multi-CPU Simulation**: Different S7 CPU types and capabilities
- **Data Block Simulation**: Organized data block access patterns
- **System Information**: CPU status, diagnostics, and system data

## Key Features
- S7-300/400 and S7-1200/1500 protocol support
- Data block (DB) and marker (M) access
- System information and diagnostics
- Multiple data types (BOOL, INT, DINT, REAL, STRING)
- Realistic CPU behavior and timing

## Performance Targets
- 2,000+ tags/second throughput
- < 2ms single tag read latency
- Bulk read optimization
- 20+ concurrent connections

## Testing Focus
- S7 protocol compliance
- Data block access patterns
- CPU compatibility across models
- Performance optimization
- Diagnostic and system data access
