# PLC Simulators

## Purpose
Generic PLC simulators that model common PLC behavior patterns.

## Planned Contents
- **Generic PLC**: Protocol-agnostic PLC simulation
- **Manufacturer Models**: Siemens, Allen-Bradley, Schneider, Omron
- **I/O Simulation**: Digital/analog input/output modeling
- **Program Logic**: Simple ladder logic and control algorithm simulation

## Key Features
- Configurable I/O point mapping
- Realistic scan cycle timing
- Fault injection capabilities
- Status and diagnostic registers
- Multiple communication protocols per PLC

## Behavior Modeling
- Scan cycle timing (1-100ms typical)
- I/O update patterns
- Alarm and event generation
- Process variable simulation
- Equipment state machines

## Testing Focus
- Multi-protocol PLC communication
- Realistic process data patterns
- PLC fault and recovery scenarios
- Performance under various scan rates
