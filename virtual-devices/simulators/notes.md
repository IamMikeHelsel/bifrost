# Virtual Device Simulators

## Purpose
Full-featured device simulators that implement complete industrial protocol stacks for integration testing.

## Contents
- Complete protocol implementations (Modbus, OPC UA, Ethernet/IP, S7)
- Realistic device behavior and timing
- Network-based communication
- Stateful device simulation
- Configuration management

## Usage
- Integration testing against real protocol implementations
- Performance testing with realistic device behavior
- End-to-end workflow validation
- Protocol compliance testing

## Future Plans
- Multi-protocol device simulators
- Cloud-based device simulation
- Manufacturer-specific device models
- Hardware-in-the-loop integration
