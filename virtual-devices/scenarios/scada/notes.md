# SCADA Scenarios

## Purpose
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system testing scenarios.

## Planned Contents
- **Multi-Site SCADA**: Distributed facility monitoring
- **Utility SCADA**: Power, water, gas distribution
- **Pipeline SCADA**: Oil and gas pipeline monitoring
- **Building Automation**: HVAC and facility management

## Components
- Multiple remote terminal units (RTUs)
- Communication over WAN/cellular networks
- Central SCADA server and HMI
- Historical data servers
- Alarm management systems

## Data Patterns
- Geographically distributed data points
- Low-frequency polling (1-60 second intervals)
- Critical alarm conditions
- Trending and historical analysis
- Communication status monitoring

## Testing Focus
- Wide area network communication
- Communication reliability and redundancy
- Alarm prioritization and escalation
- Historical data trending
- Multi-site coordination

## Performance Targets
- 99.5% communication availability
- < 5 second alarm response time
- 10,000+ remote data points
- 1-year historical data retention
- Multi-site synchronization
