# Process Control Scenarios

## Purpose
Chemical, pharmaceutical, and continuous process industry testing scenarios.

## Planned Contents
- **Continuous Process**: Chemical reactor control
- **Batch Process**: Pharmaceutical batch production
- **Safety Systems**: SIS (Safety Instrumented Systems)
- **Regulatory Compliance**: 21 CFR Part 11, GMP validation

## Components
- Distributed Control System (DCS) simulation
- Safety Instrumented System (SIS)
- Process historian integration
- Recipe and batch management
- Regulatory audit trails

## Data Patterns
- High-precision analog measurements
- Control loops and setpoints
- Batch records and recipes
- Safety interlock status
- Alarm and event chronological logs

## Testing Focus
- Process control algorithm validation
- Safety system integration
- Historical data archiving
- Regulatory compliance patterns
- Recipe execution workflows

## Performance Targets
- < 50ms control loop response
- 100% safety interlock reliability
- Continuous historical data logging
- Audit trail completeness
- Recipe execution accuracy
