# Bug Fixes Summary

This document outlines 3 critical bugs found in the Bifrost Industrial Gateway codebase and their corresponding fixes.

## Bug 1: Incorrect Uptime Calculation (Logic Error)

**Location**: `internal/gateway/server.go:437`

### Problem Description
The uptime calculation was using `time.Since(time.Now())` which always returns 0 since it calculates the duration between the current time and the current time.

### Impact
- Gateway statistics always showed 0 uptime
- Impossible to monitor service runtime duration
- Misleading operational metrics

### Root Cause
The code was trying to calculate uptime without storing the startup time, resulting in a meaningless calculation.

### Fix Applied
1. **Added startup time tracking**: Added a `startTime time.Time` field to the `IndustrialGateway` struct
2. **Initialize startup time**: Set `startTime = time.Now()` in the `NewIndustrialGateway` constructor
3. **Correct uptime calculation**: Changed `time.Since(time.Now())` to `time.Since(g.startTime)`

### Code Changes
```go
// Added to IndustrialGateway struct
type IndustrialGateway struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    startTime time.Time
}

// Updated constructor
func NewIndustrialGateway(config *Config, logger *zap.Logger) *IndustrialGateway {
    gateway := &IndustrialGateway{
        // ... existing fields ...
        startTime: time.Now(),
        // ... rest of fields ...
    }
    // ... rest of function ...
}

// Fixed uptime calculation
func (g *IndustrialGateway) GetStats() map[string]interface{} {
    return map[string]interface{}{
        "devices_total":     deviceCount,
        "devices_connected": connectedCount,
        "uptime":            time.Since(g.startTime), // Fixed calculation
    }
}
```

## Bug 2: Race Condition in WebSocket Client Management (Concurrency Issue)

**Location**: `internal/gateway/server.go:410-420`

### Problem Description
The WebSocket client management had a race condition where clients could be removed from the `sync.Map` while being accessed during iteration, and there was no proper synchronization for WebSocket operations.

### Impact
- Potential panics during concurrent access
- Memory leaks from improperly closed connections
- Data corruption in WebSocket broadcasts
- Inconsistent client state

### Root Cause
The code was modifying the `sync.Map` during iteration, which is unsafe and can cause race conditions.

### Fix Applied
1. **Collect clients for removal**: Instead of removing clients during iteration, collect them in a slice
2. **Remove after iteration**: Process removals after the iteration is complete
3. **Proper cleanup**: Ensure connections are properly closed when removed

### Code Changes
```go
func (g *IndustrialGateway) broadcastTagUpdate(device *Device, tag *Tag) {
    message := map[string]interface{}{
        "type":      "tag_update",
        "device_id": device.ID,
        "tag":       tag,
    }

    // Collect clients to remove to avoid concurrent modification
    var clientsToRemove []*websocket.Conn

    // Broadcast to all WebSocket clients
    g.wsClients.Range(func(key, value interface{}) bool {
        conn := key.(*websocket.Conn)
        if err := conn.WriteJSON(message); err != nil {
            // Mark client for removal
            clientsToRemove = append(clientsToRemove, conn)
        }
        return true
    })

    // Remove disconnected clients after iteration
    for _, conn := range clientsToRemove {
        g.wsClients.Delete(conn)
        conn.Close()
    }
}
```

## Bug 3: Missing Error Handling in Modbus Connection Pool (Resource Leak)

**Location**: `internal/protocols/modbus.go:433-450`

### Problem Description
The `getConnection` method didn't properly handle connection failures and could leave connections in an inconsistent state, potentially causing resource leaks.

### Impact
- Resource exhaustion from unclosed connections
- Degraded performance due to stale connections
- Memory leaks in connection pools
- Inconsistent connection state

### Root Cause
The connection validation was incomplete and didn't properly clean up failed or stale connections.

### Fix Applied
1. **Enhanced connection validation**: Added proper locking and validation checks
2. **Stale connection cleanup**: Automatically remove stale connections from the pool
3. **Improved error handling**: Better error messages and connection state management
4. **Added cleanup method**: Implemented `cleanupStaleConnections()` for periodic maintenance

### Code Changes
```go
func (m *ModbusHandler) getConnection(device *Device) (*ModbusConnection, error) {
    if device.ConnectionID == "" {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("device not connected")
    }

    connInterface, exists := m.connections.Load(device.ConnectionID)
    if !exists {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("connection not found")
    }

    conn := connInterface.(*ModbusConnection)
    
    // Check connection health with proper locking
    conn.mutex.RLock()
    isConnected := conn.isConnected
    conn.mutex.RUnlock()
    
    if !isConnected {
        // Clean up stale connection
        m.connections.Delete(device.ConnectionID)
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("connection is closed")
    }

    // Validate connection health
    if conn.handler == nil {
        m.connections.Delete(device.ConnectionID)
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("connection handler is nil")
    }

    return conn, nil
}

// Added cleanup method
func (m *ModbusHandler) cleanupStaleConnections() {
    var staleConnections []string
    
    m.connections.Range(func(key, value interface{}) bool {
        conn := value.(*ModbusConnection)
        conn.mutex.RLock()
        isConnected := conn.isConnected
        lastUsed := conn.lastUsed
        conn.mutex.RUnlock()
        
        // Remove connections that are disconnected or haven't been used recently
        if !isConnected || time.Since(lastUsed) > m.config.ConnectionTimeout*2 {
            staleConnections = append(staleConnections, key.(string))
        }
        return true
    })
    
    // Remove stale connections
    for _, connKey := range staleConnections {
        if connInterface, exists := m.connections.Load(connKey); exists {
            conn := connInterface.(*ModbusConnection)
            conn.mutex.Lock()
            if conn.handler != nil {
                conn.handler.Close()
            }
            conn.mutex.Unlock()
            m.connections.Delete(connKey)
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

To verify these fixes work correctly:

1. **Uptime Test**: Run the gateway and verify that uptime increases over time
2. **WebSocket Concurrency Test**: Create multiple WebSocket connections and verify no panics occur during broadcasts
3. **Connection Pool Test**: Create and destroy many Modbus connections to verify no resource leaks

## Performance Impact

These fixes improve:
- **Reliability**: Better error handling and resource management
- **Stability**: Elimination of race conditions and panics
- **Monitoring**: Accurate uptime tracking for operational visibility
- **Resource Efficiency**: Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Future Improvements

1. Add periodic connection cleanup scheduling
2. Implement connection health monitoring
3. Add metrics for connection pool performance
4. Consider using connection pooling libraries for better resource management
