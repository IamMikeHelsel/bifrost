Shows all discovered and configured devices organized by protocol. Provides quick access to connection management and monitoring.

### Live Data Points
Displays real-time values for all tags from connected devices. Supports inline reading and writing of values.

### Diagnostics
System health overview including:
- Connection status summary
- Performance metrics
- Error logs
- Python/Bifrost environment status

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Shift+B` `D`: Discover devices
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` `M`: Open monitor for selected device
- `Ctrl+Shift+B` `E`: Export data

## Troubleshooting

### No devices found
1. Ensure devices are powered on and connected to network
2. Check firewall settings for required ports
3. Verify Python and Bifrost are properly installed

### Connection failures
1. Verify device address and port settings
2. Check protocol-specific requirements
3. Review diagnostics panel for detailed errors

### Performance issues
1. Reduce data update interval in settings
2. Limit number of monitored tags
3. Close unused monitoring panels
