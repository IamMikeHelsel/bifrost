```

### Risk Mitigation

**Parallel Development**:

- Maintain current Python stack during migration
- Feature flag new Go components
- Gradual rollout to early adopters
- Quick rollback capability if issues arise

**Performance Validation**:

```go
// Continuous performance monitoring
type PerformanceMetrics struct {
    CompilationTime   time.Duration
    MemoryUsage      uint64
    ThroughputTags   int
    ConnectionCount  int
    ErrorRate        float64
}

func (m *PerformanceMetrics) ValidateTargets() bool {
    return m.CompilationTime < 1*time.Second &&
           m.MemoryUsage < 100*1024*1024 &&
           m.ThroughputTags > 10000 &&
           m.ErrorRate < 0.01
